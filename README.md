# CardMatching-AC

CardMatching-AC is a mini-game project that is testing player's memory on the relative position of paired number cards. Players are tested to memorize where
are the paired cards and by left clicking 2 cards. If 2 cards number are matched, it will remain face-up. However, if 2 cards are not matched in number, 
both cards will flip back to the default face-down position.

The game will be finished once all 52 cards have a matched pair, the number attemped will also be shown in the completed scene!
